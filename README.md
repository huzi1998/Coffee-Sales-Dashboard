2.	XLOOKUP for Dynamic Data Retrieval: Used XLOOKUP to pull information dynamically across different data sources, simplifying lookup tasks.
3.	Sales Over Time: Visualization of coffee sales categorized by coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta) and date.
4.	Top Customers: Identification of top 5 customers based on total sales, offering insights into customer loyalty and profitability.
5.	Sales by Country: Geographic breakdown of sales across major markets like the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland.
6.	Detailed Order Tracking: Comprehensive order data, including customer details, order dates, product types, and quantities.
